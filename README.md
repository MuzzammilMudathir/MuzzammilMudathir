### Hi there

Hello, I'm Muzzammil Mudathir, an undergraduate Computer Science student based in Canada. My passion lies at the intersection of web and game development, where I leverage my skills to create engaging and innovative digital experiences. While these areas are my primary focus, my curiosity drives me to continuously explore various other sectors within computer science. I believe in the power of technology to transform ideas into reality, and I'm committed to learning and growing in this ever-evolving field.
